# Drone-Simulator
This is the start of a 2D top down simulation software to emulate custom "drones" in various custom enviroments.
## Goal
I want to set out to create some software to be able to create a "drone" in a "lego like" build system where you can build the drone in various stages. The idea is be able to build the frame of the drone; then, place electronic components on it to accomplish various jobs. Furthermore, depending on the components added, you could program the drone to do the various task. Lastly, set the created drone in one of the premade enviroments or create a custom one to test the capabilities.
## Features - Currently finishing Stage 1
### Stage 1
- Use GLFW/Glew to create the simulation engine.
  - Simulation Engine
  - Render Engine
  - Meshes
  - UI
  - Input/Event Systems
  - Serialization/Deserialization
  - Embedded scriptable languages (ie. JavaScript, Python, or Lua)
### Stage 2
- Make the simulator
  - Buildable drone frames
  - Attachable components
  - Scriptable microprocessors
  - Designable enviroments
### Stage 3
- Physic simulation
- Lidar/Radar simulation
### Stage 4
TBD
### Stage X
TBD
