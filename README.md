# Codex-Core

A 2D modular engine to be used for various personal projects.

## Goal

This is the core of many modular extentions to be used in various ways. The idea is a "game" engine into several modules that can be added to a project to add more features. Planned modules can be an extention that integrates software like PyTorch or Tensorflow to add AI training capability to the engine or a simulation module for observing different behaviors based on project. This should reduce bloated code if a project doesn't need certain features.

## Features

- Graphical Rendering System using GLFW/Glew
- Custom mesh control and mesh instancing
- Custom UI system and ImGui for additional gui needs
- Texture mapping and texture atlas support
- Compute shader support
- Input/Event Systems [PLANNED]
- Serialization/Deserialization [PLANNED]
- Embedded scriptable languages (ie. JavaScript, Python, Lua, etc) [PLANNED]

## Modules

- AI/Machine Learning (integration with PyTorch or Tensorflow) [PLANNED]
- Simulation [PLANNED]
- Editor [PLANNED]
